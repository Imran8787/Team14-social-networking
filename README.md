# Team Vibe Net - Microblog Project

## Project Description

Team Vibe Net is a simple microblogging web application designed for engineering students to practice and showcase their web development skills. This project allows users to post short messages limited to 
140 characters, including mentions (@username) and hashtags (#topic), with a live character counter to help keep track of the limit. The interface features a clean design with light and dark theme options,
profile images, and random likes and retweets counters to simulate a social media experience. The project is built with separate HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files to make the code organized and easier to 
understand. This project helped me learn how to handle user input, manipulate the webpage dynamically using JavaScript, and style pages effectively with CSS.
